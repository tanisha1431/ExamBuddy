							<p><h3>What's the pain or problem that you're trying to solve and why?</h3><br>
                            In a time where online classes is the norm individuals feel disconnected as they don't get to do the collaborative group studies which not only had the potential of improving the efficiency of studies but also take out the stress out of the minds of the individuals. While trying to solve this problem the intention is to create a tool which promotes collaborative studies among individuals in existing platforms familiar to them like Discord</p>
                            <p><h3>Who's affected by the pain or problem?</h3><br>

                            <p><h3>Does this problem have a tendency to grow and why?</h3><br>
                            The problem has a tendency to grow and persist in such times where physically meeting people is not something everyone has the luxury to do.</p>
