## Implementation

We will be using node.js serverside javascript framework to handle the various commands that the user will input. Every time the user gives a command to add some image to the database the discord url will be taken and added to the mongodb database along with the tags that the user enters based on which the various notes can be queried. There will also be an OCR functionality where the user can add the picture and the bot will perform OCR and return the recognised string along with the google search lin which can improve the efficiency of searching probable solutions.
The bot will be deployed to the cloud on heroku for testing purposes so that the bot doesn’t need to be running constantly on the local system. For the final stage we intend to deploy the bot to AWS because of the multitudes of features that it provides

### For implementation of this project we will be using the following tech frameworks and technologies -:
